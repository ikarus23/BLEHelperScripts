They might have different requirements like bluez, bluepy, pygatt, bleak or whatever.

General Information
-------------------

This is just intended as a collection of scripts which might help some people to get started.
They have been tested with Arch Linux at some point, but there is no guarantee that anything
will work.

So far there is not much. Hopefully there will be more scripts in the future. Also, feel
free to create a pull request to add your own script.
